I conduct research on environmental problems, including climate change and acidification, affecting glacial lakes. I am also interested in functional ecology of ponds and how invertebrate diversity links with decomposition and production processes. As a conservation biologists, I try to assess efficiency of surrogate species for biodiversity conservation. My further interests encompass taxonomy of aquatic insects, forest disturbances, biological invasions and ecological modelling.","affiliation":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Technical University in Zvolen","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/institution\/Technical_University_in_Zvolen"}},{"@type":"WebPage","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Marek-Svitok","reviewedBy":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marek Svitok"}}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/","name":"Home"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/institution\/Technical_University_in_Zvolen","name":"Technical University in Zvolen"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/institution\/Technical_University_in_Zvolen\/department\/Department_of_Biology_and_General_Ecology","name":"Department of Biology and General Ecology"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Marek-Svitok","name":"Marek Svitok"}}]}]
