Within this broad context, he has specific research interests in the ecology, evolution and conservation biology of Australia's reptiles and amphibians. A fundamental interest in these fascinating animals takes him into the field and the laboratory to learn more of their biology and to apply what he has learned in solving contemporary problems of their conservation.","affiliation":{"@type":"Organization","name":"University of Canberra","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/institution\/University_of_Canberra"}},{"@type":"WebPage","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Arthur-Georges","reviewedBy":{"@type":"Person","name":"Arthur Georges"}}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/","name":"Home"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/institution\/University_of_Canberra","name":"University of Canberra"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/institution\/University_of_Canberra\/department\/Institute_for_Applied_Ecology_IAE","name":" Institute for Applied Ecology (IAE)"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Arthur-Georges","name":"Arthur Georges"}}]}]
