I am particularly interested in the evolutionary patterns of the Cordylidae, a family of diversely armored lizards that are endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa. This work requires a combination of morphological, biogeographical and phylogenetic analyses to untangle the complex processes that drive diversification.","affiliation":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Florida Museum of Natural History","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/institution\/Florida_Museum_of_Natural_History"},"award":["Best Student paper. 11th conference of the Herpetological Association of Africa","Tracy Storer award, Joint meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, Providence, RI"]},{"@type":"WebPage","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Edward-Stanley-5","reviewedBy":{"@type":"Person","name":"Edward L Stanley"}}]},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/","name":"Home"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/institution\/Florida_Museum_of_Natural_History","name":"Florida Museum of Natural History"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"item":{"@id":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Edward-Stanley-5","name":"Edward L Stanley"}}]}]
